#### Genesis

Alright, they say a journey of a thousand miles begins with a step. This is the
first step.

The prose might be bad, the content might be shallow, the structure might be a
mess, apologies in advance. 

I intend to write about anything and everything that interests me.
- Book reviews
- Programming
- Cybersecurity
- Games
- Movies
- Life

Expect more content soon. Been interested in Rustlang lately, will probably
start looking into some personal projects, perhaps in fuzzing or webassembly,
should be fun.
